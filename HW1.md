## Math Introduction
### Some modular arithmetic

- Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

    What is

    a) 4 + 4  

    => 1

    b) 3 x 5 

    => 1

    c) what is the inverse of 3 ? 

    => 4

- For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

    Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ? 

    => yes

- What is -13 mod 5 ?

    => 2

- Polynomials For the polynomial $(x^3 - x^2 + 4x - 12)$

  - Find the positive root ? 

    => 2

  - What is the degree of this polynomial ? 

    => 3

## Use cases
In your teams discuss any systems you have used that involved zero knowledge proofs.
- Have you seen any applications of zero knowledge proofs other than with a blockchain ? 

   => voting systems, proof-of-identity
- What is to you, the most important feature of zkp technology ? 
   
   => privacy
- Think of some use cases of zero knowledge proofs that you would like to see developed.

  => proof-of-identity
